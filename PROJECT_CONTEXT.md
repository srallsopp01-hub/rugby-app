# FYNL Whistle — Project Context File

**Last updated:** May 2026 — Terms of Service and Privacy Policy live (`/terms`, `/privacy`); footer and signup wired. Pre-launch checklist: items 1 (Stripe live prices), 2 (Sentry), 3 (email/DNS) remain. Move 3 (BI) and all Stripe webhook batches (BE–BH) complete.
**Purpose:** Paste this at the start of any new chat with Claude to restore full project context instantly.

## What this app is

A rugby match analysis web app built in **Next.js / React / TypeScript**.

It helps coaches:
- Upload and review match video
- Tag player and team events live or via transcript import
- Use voice tagging (push-to-talk via spacebar)
- Review team and player performance
- Generate analysis outputs and downloadable reports

It is currently a **coach-first MVP**, live at [fynlwhistle.com](https://fynlwhistle.com), best used on desktop/laptop, one coach per browser/device.

---

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (custom design tokens via CSS variables in `globals.css`)
- localStorage-first match persistence with Supabase cloud sync for saved match records and Cloudflare R2 video storage paths
- localStorage for browser-local colour scheme preference (`dark` / `bright`)
- Anthropic API for voice transcription (`/api/transcribe`)
- ExcelJS for `.xlsx` report generation

## Organisation / Team / User Spec

This is the source of truth for the multi-tenant data model. As of Move 2 (Batch BD, May 2026), this is implemented in production.

### Concepts

**Organisation** — the billing entity. One Stripe subscription belongs to exactly one organisation. An organisation has a name, a plan, a billing relationship, and contains one or more teams. Solo coaches have a "ghost organisation" — it exists in the database for billing but the word "organisation" never appears in the Team Launch UI.

**Team** — the actual rugby team. Owns a squad of players, fixtures, training sessions, colours, lineout calls, saved matches, and videos. Every team belongs to exactly one organisation. Replaces the old `squad_profiles` concept, with `organisation_id` added.

**User** — a person with a Supabase auth account (email + password). A user is just an identity. They get capabilities by being a member of one or more teams (via `team_members`) and possibly one or more organisations (via `organisation_members`). Users own no data directly — teams own data, organisations own teams.

### Roles

Five roles total, split across two membership tables.

**Organisation-level (`organisation_members`):**
- **`club_admin`** — owns billing, creates/deletes teams, oversees the org. Read-only access across all teams in the org by default. Can also hold a team-level role concurrently.

**Team-level (`team_members`):**
- **`head_coach`** — full control of a team. Tags, grades, manages squad, invites members, uploads videos. Multiple head coaches per team allowed.
- **`assistant_coach`** — coaching access without admin powers. Can tag, grade, write coach notes, upload videos. Cannot manage squad structure or invite members.
- **`player`** — sees their own data and read-only team analytics. Submits availability. Linked to a `SquadPlayer` record via `linked_user_id`.
- **`player_admin`** — *(deferred — not implemented)*

`coach_label` (free text, e.g. "Forwards", "Backs", "Manager") stays as a cosmetic display label. `role` is the permission boundary.

### Plans

Four plan types in the `plan` enum. `solo` is reserved for future use, unreachable in UI. Existing users backfilled as `team_launch`.

| Plan | Teams | Coach seats | Players (per team) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `solo` (reserved) | 1 | 1 | 30 |
| `team_launch` | 1 | 4 | 50 |
| `club_5` | 5 | 30 | 50 per team |
| `org_custom` | unlimited | unlimited | unlimited |

Plan defaults live in a `PLAN_LIMITS` constant in application code. Per-org overrides via nullable columns (`team_limit`, `seat_limit`, `player_limit`) on the `organisations` table. Move 2 shipped with limits set to NULL — schema in place, enforcement turned on later when ready. Active players only count toward the player limit. Coach seats include `head_coach`, `assistant_coach`, and `club_admin`. Players don't count toward seat limits.

### Tables (current schema after Move 2)

#### `organisations`id                      uuid primary key

organisation_id         uuid → organisations not null

invited_by_user_id  uuid → auth.users null
invited_at, accepted_at, removed_at, left_team_at

#### `user_profiles` (new)user_id                 uuid primary key → auth.users cascade
has_used_trial          boolean not null default false
last_active_team_id     uuid → teams null on delete set null

#### `stripe_events_processed` (new — for future Stripe webhook)event_id            text primary key
processed_at        timestamptz not null default now()

### RLS principles

Read access to a team's data requires either:
(a) an active `team_members` row for that team (status = 'active'),
(b) an active `club_admin` row in `organisation_members` for the team's organisation, or
(c) being a `linked_user_id` on a SquadPlayer in the team's `players` JSONB array.

Write access requires `team_members` with `role IN ('head_coach', 'assistant_coach')`. Players can only write their own availability responses.

Squad management requires `role = 'head_coach'`. Org-level team management requires `role = 'club_admin'`.

Helper functions: `can_read_team_data(p_team_id uuid)` and `can_manage_team(p_team_id uuid)` — extended from the original `20260501000003_player_read_access` migration to handle the new role enum and org-level access.

### Player data export

Players can export their performance history as a PDF at any time, including from teams they've left (because `linked_user_id` is preserved on inactive SquadPlayers after departure). Live cross-team "career view" deferred to a future batch — data model already supports it.

### Open questions deliberately deferred

These are decisions consciously not made, with the data model designed not to preclude them:
- Live player career view — data model supports it, no UI built. Future batch.
- Per-team merge into Club 5 — viral club adoption case. Manual via admin panel until volume justifies self-serve.
- Per-team add-on pricing — Club 5 capped at 5 teams. Manual until volume justifies self-serve.
- `solo` plan as a free tier — enum reserved, no UI. Decision deferred until conversion data is available.
- Per-match `visibility = 'team'` private mode — column reserved, UI not built.
- Disappeared club admin self-serve recovery — handled manually until volume justifies self-serve.
- First-class `seasons` table — currently a text field. FK migration possible later.
- `player_admin` role — reserved as a concept, not built.

## Player app privacy rule

Player-facing pages may show shared team and teammate stats, but must not show other players' grades, private coach comments, or unscoped coach notes. Grades and coaching plans are only shown for the currently selected player. Match-level free-text coach notes are hidden in the player app until the data model can assign notes to a specific player.

---

## Design tokens (globals.css)

Theme CSS variables available as Tailwind classes. Default is the dark scheme; a browser-local bright scheme can be selected via the shared theme toggle and is stored in `localStorage` as `fynlwhistle-theme-scheme`.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-background` | #0b0c0f | Base page background |
| `bg-background-elevated` | #111317 | Elevated surfaces |
| `bg-panel` | #17191d | Cards and panels |
| `bg-panel-2` | #1d2025 | Inset / secondary panels |
| `bg-panel-3` | #23272d | Active sidebar items |
| `text-foreground` | #d7dbe2 | Primary text |
| `text-foreground-strong` | #f1f4f8 | Headings / strong text |
| `text-muted` | #98a0ab | Secondary text |
| `text-muted-2` | #7e8793 | Tertiary / labels |
| `border-border` | #373c44 | Default borders |
| `border-border-light` | #505762 | Hover/active borders |
| `text-success` | #7ea37e | Muted green |
| `text-warning` | #b79a63 | Muted gold |
| `text-danger` | #b16e6e | Muted red |

Body has a radial + linear gradient applied. Buttons get `translateY(-1px)` on hover. Inputs have 0.18s transitions.

Bright scheme:
- Uses white / off-white surfaces with black text and orange accent (`--accent: #ed6a1f`).
- Applies across marketing, coach, player, and admin through `data-theme-scheme="bright"` on `<html>`.
- Video and product mock areas may stay dark where they represent match footage or film UI.

## Layout pattern (coach / player / admin)

All three platform layouts use the same structure:

```tsx
<div className="flex h-screen overflow-hidden">   // locks to viewport
  <Sidebar />
  <main className="flex-1 overflow-auto">          // only this scrolls
    {children}
  </main>
</div>
```

Sidebar pattern:
- 220px wide (coach/player) or 200px (admin)
- Left accent bar (`w-[3px] rounded-r-full bg-foreground-strong`) on active link
- Logo mark + platform name + sub-label in header
- `transition-all duration-150` on nav links
- `fynlwhistle.com` footer label

## Data model summary

**Events** (`EventItem[]`) — core data structure. Each event has:
- `id`, `timestamp`, `text`, `rawText?`, `isPending?`
- `category`: `"player"` | `"set-piece"` | `"team"` | `"milestone"` | `"substitution"`
- Player events: `playerName?`, `playerAction?`, `secondPlayerName?`
- Set piece events: `setPieceType`, `setPieceSide`, `lineoutResult?`, `scrumResult?`, `notes?`
- Team events: `teamEventType`

**TeamEventType** (types.ts): `"penalty for"` | `"penalty conceded"` | `"try scored"` | `"try conceded"`

**MilestoneType** (types.ts): `"kick off"` | `"half time"` | `"second half kick off"` | `"full time"`

**RosterRow**: `number`, `name`, `position`, `minutes`, `playerId?` (SquadPlayer.id, resolved at roster entry time)

**SquadProfile** (lib/squadProfile.ts — cross-match, persistent): `id`, `teamName`, `coachName`, `primaryColour`, `secondaryColour`, `logoUrl`, `players[]`, `actionSamples[]`, `correctionMemory[]`, `fixtures?[]`, `trainingSessions?[]`, `availabilityResponses?[]`, `sessionLogs?[]`, `leaguePosition?`

**SavedMatchRecord** (lib/savedMatches.ts — local-first, cloud synced): `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `matchTitle`, `opponent`, `matchDate`, `activeMode`, `rosterRows[]`, `selectedPlayer`, `events[]`, `reviewQueue[]`, `coachNotes[]`, `clips?`, `showRawTranscript`, `videoStoragePath?`

**SquadPlayer**: `id`, `fullName`, `preferredName`, `nicknames[]`, `primaryPosition`, `secondaryPositions[]`, `jerseyNumber`, `voiceSamples[]`, `status`, `email?`, `linkedUserId?`

**CorrectionMemoryEntry**: `rawWhisperText`, `resolvedPlayerName`, `resolvedAction`, `count`

---

## Storage

- **Match session:** `localStorage` key `STORAGE_KEY` (defined in constants.ts)
- **Correction memory (v2):** `localStorage` key `CORRECTION_MEMORY_KEY`
- **Squad Profile (cross-match):** `localStorage` key `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` (via lib/squadProfile.ts)
- **Onboarding completion:** `localStorage` key `ONBOARDING_COMPLETE_KEY`
- **Current match ID:** `localStorage` (via savedMatches lib)
- **Saved matches list:** `localStorage` first + Supabase `saved_matches` sync (via savedMatches lib and `lib/savedMatchesCloud.ts`), including optional `video_storage_path`
- **Video:** current-device `sessionStorage` blob URL for immediate playback; authenticated head coaches upload match files directly to Cloudflare R2 with server-issued signed URLs
- **Player identity:** `localStorage` key `rugby-player-selected-id` (SquadPlayer.id, via PlayerContext). Authenticated player members are auto-linked from `team_members.player_squad_id`.
- **Cloud storage:** Supabase auth/database for `squad_profiles`, `saved_matches`, `team_members`, `invite_tokens`; Cloudflare R2 for private match video objects.

---

## Important product rules (never break these)

1. **No hardcoded team logic in core product** — keep everything generalisable for any team
2. **Capture page is tagging only** — do not add analytics or clip review to it
3. **Insights is analytics only** — do not add clip review or tagging to it
4. **Review is teaching/review only** — do not add tagging to it
5. **Player logins are scoped by invite** — authenticated player members load their coach's shared team data and only see their own private grades/coaching plan.
6. **Local-first persistence with cloud sync** — saved match records and squad profiles remain local-first; coach accounts sync metadata to Supabase, and match videos are stored in private Cloudflare R2 objects.
7. **Desktop-first** — not optimised for mobile
8. **Spacebar = voice recording only** — must never trigger a focused button
9. **Transcript always sorted by timestamp** — oldest at top, newest at bottom
10. **"Latest" badge follows highest timestamp**, not last array item
11. **Screens stay separate** — platform layers are independent, with their own layouts

---

## Spacebar / button focus fix pattern

**Fix pattern:** Every event-logging button must:
1. Have `type="button"` explicitly set
2. Call `event.currentTarget.blur()` immediately after its click handler runs via a `runAndBlur` helper

**Applied to:**
- ✅ `TeamEventsPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `MatchdayRosterPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `SetPieceLoggingPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `NeedsReviewPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `MatchMilestonesPanel.tsx`

If new event-logging buttons are added anywhere, apply this same pattern immediately.

---

## Voice matching pipeline — current state

1. Learned correction memory (per-session, v2 format) — fires first, bypasses everything else
2. Squad resolution of GPT's `parsed.player` — preferred name, nickname, surname
3. Token scan of rawText against squad — squad candidates built
4. `tokenResolvedName` promoted if unique token match and no parsed player
5. `parsedPlayerIsValid` = resolved OR token-resolved OR exact roster match
6. Auto-match: `hasKnownAction && parsedPlayerIsValid && highEnoughConfidence`
7. Pending Resolution: `hasKnownAction && mergedCandidates.length > 0` (squad candidates first)
8. Needs Review: everything else

Double-tackle support: when `squadCandidates.length >= 2` and action is tackle, second player pre-filled in `PendingResolutionPanel`.

---

## What was completed

### Batch B (April 2026)
- ✅ Lineout Call Summary added to Match Report modal
- ✅ Lineout Calls sheet added to .xlsx download (Sheet 3)
- ✅ Download strategy simplified — one report, one transcript download
- ✅ Dead code removed

### Batch C (April 2026)
- ✅ Match milestone buttons (Kick Off, Half Time, Second Half KO, Full Time)
- ✅ Bench bring-on flow with substitution logging
- ✅ Squad Profile lib created (`lib/squadProfile.ts`)
- ✅ `/squad` page — team details, add/edit/remove players

- ✅ Token scanning of rawText against squad
- ✅ Correction memory split to v2 (player + action stored separately)
- ✅ Double-tackle support — second player tracked, text and export updated

### Route architecture migration — Phases 1–9 (April 2026)
- ✅ Phase 1: Repo scaffold (App Router folders, routing plan)
- ✅ Phase 2: globals.css dark theme tokens, root layout
- ✅ Phase 3: `/team-dashboard` → `/coach/insights`
- ✅ Phase 4: `/game-review` → `/coach/review`
- ✅ Phase 5: `/player-dashboard` → `/coach/players`
- ✅ Phase 6: `/saved-matches` → `/coach/saved-matches`
- ✅ Phase 7: Workspace → `/coach/capture`
- ✅ Phase 8: Public marketing homepage at `/`
- ✅ Phase 9: `/player` and `/admin` layout scaffolds with sidebars
- Old redirect stubs remain at legacy routes for now

### Phase 10 — Aesthetic and layout polish (April 2026)
- ✅ Layout fix: coach/player/admin use `h-screen overflow-hidden`, sidebar stays fixed
- ✅ Coach sidebar: left accent bar on active link, FYNL Whistle logo mark, refined transitions
- ✅ Player/Admin sidebars: same accent bar + logo mark treatment applied
- ✅ Marketing layout: logo mark in header, tighter button styling
- ✅ Marketing homepage: radial hero glow, contrast headline, status dot badge, feature cards with icons and hover, CTA in panel card
- ✅ Coach Home: quick nav card grid to Capture / Insights / Review / Players
- ✅ All stub pages: consistent "In development" amber badge + dashed-border placeholder + purposeful description

### Batch D (April 2026)
- ✅ Voice tagging during video playback — removed native `<video controls>`, added custom Play/Pause button + seek bar; spacebar no longer pauses video
- ✅ Team Setup page — `/coach/team-setup` was already live (completed in Phase 7 migration); `/squad` redirects to it
- ✅ Collapsible coach sidebar — animates 220px ↔ 56px (icon-only), persists to localStorage, chevron toggle, native title tooltips
- ✅ Needs Review volume — Whisper prompt with player names + action words; expanded GPT action synonyms (jackal→turnover, run→carry, etc.); preferred names + nicknames sent to API

### Batch E (April 2026)
- ✅ Collapsible player sidebar — mirrors CoachSidebar pattern exactly, localStorage key `"player-sidebar-collapsed"`, independent of coach key
- ✅ Clip tagging on Review screen — Mark Start / Mark End flow captures video segments with a label; clips listed with click-to-jump; persisted to localStorage under existing STORAGE_KEY; `ClipAnnotation` type added to types.ts
- ✅ Cross-match player trends in Insights — loads all saved matches via `getSavedMatches()`, computes per-player stats with `buildReportRowsFromMatch()`, shows tackle%/carries/grade per match with trend arrows (↑↓→); gated behind 2+ matches

### Batch F (April 2026)
- ✅ Needs Review reduction — `resolvePlayerName` now has a fuzzy surname fallback (Levenshtein ≤ 1 on surnames ≥ 4 chars); GPT prompt updated so action-clear + player-uncertain gives `confidence: "medium"` and always populates `candidate_players`; routes more tags to PendingResolution instead of Needs Review
- ✅ Clip categories on Review — `category?: string` added to `ClipAnnotation`; pill-button picker (Breakdown, Set Piece, Kick, Defence, Attack, Other) in clip confirm flow; saved clips show a muted category badge in the list
- ✅ Player trends drilldown — clicking a player row in the Insights trends table expands a detail sub-table showing full per-match stats (tackles, missed, carries, turnovers, involvements, grade); one row open at a time

---

### Batch G (April 2026)
- ✅ Dedicated `/coach/onboarding` route added for first-time coach setup
- ✅ `/coach` redirects first-time coaches to onboarding when onboarding is incomplete and no named squad profile exists
- ✅ Onboarding wizard supports team details, manual squad player entry, and voice tagging guidance
- ✅ "Skip for now" marks onboarding complete and returns to `/coach` without creating or overwriting squad profile data
- ✅ Capture roster seeding intentionally left out — `/coach/capture` keeps its existing team-sheet/session flow

---

### Batch H (April 2026)
- ✅ `/coach/compare` is now live as a desktop-first, side-by-side comparison screen
- ✅ Match comparison mode compares two saved localStorage matches using the same shared analytics helpers as Insights/export
- ✅ Player comparison mode compares one player from each selected saved match with KPI deltas
- ✅ Compare is read-only and comparison-only — no tagging, film review, video playback, saved-match editing, backend, or cloud storage

---

### Batch I (April 2026)
- ✅ Coach Home upgraded from simple quick links to a next-action dashboard
- ✅ Coach Home now shows active/latest saved match, saved-match count, last saved time, resolved event count, open review count, and report readiness
- ✅ Compare and Saved Matches added to Coach Home quick links
- ✅ Shared `matchConfidence.ts` helper added for saved match labels, localStorage confidence counts, and Ready for report / Needs review status
- ✅ Insights, Review, Compare, and Saved Matches now show match context/confidence cues
- ✅ Compare prevents same-match comparison and labels stats as based on resolved tagged events
- ✅ Root metadata no longer says Create Next App
- ✅ Scoped Next 16/React lint stability improved: full lint now exits with warnings only

---

### Batch J (April 2026)
- ✅ Marketing homepage polished with a product-first bold sport layout
- ✅ Homepage app tour upgraded to a client-side slider covering Coach Home, Capture, Insights, Players, Review, Team Setup, Saved Matches, and Compare
- ✅ Capture slide highlights specific Capture areas: video timeline, quick tags, voice tagging, transcript, and report flow
- ✅ Whole-product dark / bright colour scheme preference added via shared CSS tokens and `ThemeSchemeToggle`
- ✅ Bright scheme uses white/off-white surfaces with orange and black accents; preference persists in browser localStorage
- ✅ Theme toggle is available from marketing header and coach/player/admin sidebars

---

---

### Batch K (April 2026)
- ✅ Insights page fully redesigned as a 4-tab SaaS analytics dashboard
- ✅ Tab 1 — Overview: season snapshot strip (2+ matches), 8 KPI hero cards, top performers, players needing attention, unit summary, team totals
- ✅ Tab 2 — Game Analysis: headline insights, coaching comment, game flow, set piece CSS bar charts (lineout + scrum), discipline tiles, unit performance table
- ✅ Tab 3 — Players: position filter pills (All / Forwards / Backs), full player table with GradeBadge, player comment cards
- ✅ Tab 4 — Season Trends: locked state < 2 matches; season KPI averages, 3 Recharts bar charts (tackle %, tries, lineout %), player grade progression table
- ✅ Export button moved to persistent page header, always accessible from any tab
- ✅ recharts added as a dependency for multi-match bar charts

---

### Batch L (April 2026)
- ✅ Team Setup multi-select positions — replaced free-text secondary positions input with a proper checkbox dropdown; first selected = primary, rest = secondary; `primaryPosition` and `secondaryPositions[]` on `SquadPlayer` type used directly
- ✅ Jersey number field removed from player entry form; `jerseyNumber` always writes `null` (field remains in type for backwards compat)
- ✅ Player list sorted by position order (front row → backs) using `POSITION_OPTIONS` index; alphabetical tiebreaker
- ✅ "No." column removed from player table; Position column shows primary + secondary positions inline

---

### Batch L addendum (April 2026)
- ✅ Compare page: Player tab now allows same-match selection so two players from the same game can be compared side by side
- ✅ When same match active, right player auto-defaults to the second roster player (not the same as left); a context note confirms single-match scope
- ✅ Match tab retains the existing same-match block and warning unchanged

---

### Batch M (April 2026)
- ✅ Player platform fully built out — all 5 pages live with real localStorage data
- ✅ Player identity: localStorage key `rugby-player-selected-id` (SquadPlayer.id); `PlayerContext.tsx` provides `currentPlayer`, `setCurrentPlayer`, `clearCurrentPlayer`; `PlayerPicker.tsx` shown when no player selected
- ✅ Player Home — latest match card (grade, opponent, stats), season averages strip, coach comment (auto-generated from ReportRow), focus area tip derived from lowest-graded stat
- ✅ Games — all saved matches where player appears in roster, sorted newest first, clickable cards with grade badge and stat subrow
- ✅ Game Detail — stat grid (tackle %, carries, involvements, minutes), coach comment, player event timeline, match-level coach notes
- ✅ Performance — plain English trend bullets (vs season average), season KPI cards, recharts bar charts (tackle % + carries per game), grade progression table; locked state < 2 matches
- ✅ Review — playlist of all player events grouped by match, action badges + timestamps; note to reopen in Review for video
- ✅ Account (`/player/settings`) — player profile, "Change player" clears identity, theme toggle
- ✅ PlayerSidebar shows player name + position when selected
- ✅ GradeBadge extracted to shared `app/components/GradeBadge.tsx` (was inline in insights)
- ✅ Hydration fix: both CoachSidebar and PlayerSidebar `collapsed` state now deferred to `useEffect` (was causing SSR mismatch via `localStorage` in lazy useState initialiser)

---

### Batch N (April 2026) — Player platform validation + hydration fixes
- ✅ Inline theme script added to `app/layout.tsx` — reads `fynlwhistle-theme-scheme` from localStorage before React hydrates and sets `data-theme-scheme` on `<html>`; eliminates dark→bright flash on reload for users with bright scheme saved
- ✅ `app/layout.tsx` has `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` to silence expected attribute mismatch from the inline script
- ✅ `ThemeSchemeToggle.tsx` updated — state starts as `"dark"`, syncs from localStorage in `useEffect`, `suppressHydrationWarning` on wrapper div
- ✅ `PlayerSidebar.tsx` — `suppressHydrationWarning` added to `<aside>` to suppress collapsed-state width mismatch during hydration

---

### Batch O (April 2026) — Player platform depth + video playlist
- ✅ `PlayerPicker` — shows last game date per player below their name ("No games yet" if none); loaded from saved matches on mount
- ✅ `/player/review` — repurposed for coach notes: shows timestamped film review notes from saved matches grouped by match; "Watch game →" links to game detail; note about clip videos coming with cloud
- ✅ `/player/games/[gameId]` — full video playlist experience: player loads match video file, events become seekable playlist (seeks to timestamp −3s, Prev/Next controls, active event highlighted); event timeline shown as fallback when no video; grade badges on stat cards; set piece section retained
- ✅ `/player/performance` — SaaS analytics redesign: season totals strip (tackles, carries, turnovers, involvements); colour-coded grade cards per metric with threshold context and delta vs previous game; season bests section (best tackle %, most carries, most involvements) linked to game detail; chart headers show season avg; grade-by-game table has Latest badge, game links, and season accuracy footnote

---

### Batch P (April 2026) — Coach → player clip pipeline
- ✅ `SavedMatchRecord` extended with `clips?: ClipAnnotation[]` — optional, backwards-compatible
- ✅ `coach/review/page.tsx` — `saveClipsToStorage` now also calls `upsertSavedMatch` via `getCurrentMatchId()` so clips are persisted to the saved match record whenever they are created or deleted
- ✅ `player/review/page.tsx` — full clip section added above the existing notes section: per-match video loader (blob URL, same UX as games/[gameId]), seekable clip playlist (click to seek to startTime − 3s, auto-scroll), Prev/Next controls, category badges (Attack/Defence/other), active-clip highlight; notes section retained as "Match Notes"; unified empty state

---

### Batch Q (April 2026) — Coach Review meeting-room upgrade
- ✅ Review autosave fixed — `/coach/review` now writes coach notes, clips, annotations, and raw-transcript preference through one shared persistence path to both `STORAGE_KEY` and the current saved match record when available
- ✅ Capture restore/autosave preserves saved `clips` so reopening a saved match in Capture no longer drops Review-created clip data from the active session
- ✅ Clip workflow upgraded — spacebar start/end is scoped to `/coach/review`, clip ranges are editable with start/end fields, and the right-side playlist remains visible with All / Attack / Defence / Set Piece filters
- ✅ `VideoAnnotation` added and `ClipAnnotation.annotations?` introduced as optional/backwards-compatible clip data for arrows, circles, and highlights tied to clips
- ✅ Coach Review layout now feels like a team meeting tool: video and controls on the left, persistent clip playlist on the right, timeline/snapshot retained below the playlist
- ✅ Coaching notes display improved with a structured, rule-based insight panel that groups tackles, missed tackles, carries, turnovers, set piece, and team events before raw transcript noise
- ✅ Verification: focused lint passed for touched files with only existing Capture warnings; `npm run build` passed; `/coach/review` returned 200 locally

---

### Batch R (April 2026) — Coach Settings local data controls
- ✅ `/coach/settings` upgraded from stub to live browser-local settings page
- ✅ Settings now shows saved match count, current match presence, squad/team profile status, correction memory count, onboarding state, selected player identity, and known local data size
- ✅ Quick links added for Team Setup, Onboarding, Saved Matches, and Player Platform
- ✅ Shared `ThemeSchemeToggle` added to Settings
- ✅ Raw JSON export added for known FYNL Whistle localStorage keys
- ✅ Guarded data controls added: clear current match, reset correction memory, clear player identity, and factory reset known FYNL Whistle local data only
- ✅ Settings storage snapshot uses `useSyncExternalStore` to avoid the new React lint rule against synchronous state writes in effects
- ✅ Verification: focused lint passed for `app/coach/settings/page.tsx`; `npm run build` passed; `/coach/settings` returned 200 locally; full repo lint still fails on pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` errors in other coach/player files

---

### Batch S (April 2026) — Capture quality improvements
- ✅ Try scorer name — clicking "Try Scored" opens inline player picker; squad select dropdown with "Log" / "Skip (no name)"; name included in event text and stored on `playerName` field
- ✅ Penalty conceded name — same inline picker flow for "Penalty Conceded"
- ✅ `TeamEventsPanel` now accepts `squad: SquadPlayer[]` prop and has local `pendingNameFor` state for the picker; `onAddTryScored` and `onAddPenaltyConceded` callbacks updated to `(playerName?: string) => void`
- ✅ `buildTeamEventText()` updated to accept optional `playerName?` — returns `"Try Scored — James Smith"` when name provided
- ✅ Substitution display in transcript — structured row showing `[PlayerOff] off → [Position] ← [PlayerOn] on` using the existing `substitutionPlayerOn/Off/Position` fields; no text input (read-only)
- ✅ Voice confidence badge in PendingResolutionPanel — "Low confidence" amber badge for `confidence: "low"`; "Review" muted badge for `"medium"`; nothing for `"high"` or absent; `confidence?` field added to `PendingResolution` type and wired from `parsed?.confidence` in capture page
- ✅ Live set piece % in Capture — `SetPieceLoggingPanel` now accepts `lineoutPct?` and `scrumPct?` props; shown as `"X% won"` pill badge next to section header; only shown once ≥1 event logged; values sourced from existing `setPieceSummary` useMemo
- ✅ Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z keyboard shortcut for undo last tag in Capture (existing `undoLast()` function); respects the typing-field guard so it won't fire inside text inputs

---

### Batch T (April 2026) — Lint stability cleanup
- ✅ Full `npm run lint` now exits 0 with no output (was: 11 errors, 13 warnings)
- ✅ All `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` errors eliminated — 11 setState calls in effects replaced with `useSyncExternalStore` + `useMemo` across 10 files
- ✅ CoachSidebar / PlayerSidebar: collapsed state driven by `useSyncExternalStore` + custom window event; toggle writes to localStorage and dispatches the event
- ✅ ThemeSchemeToggle: scheme state via `useSyncExternalStore`; `applyScheme` only called in `chooseScheme` (layout inline script handles mount)
- ✅ PlayerContext: `currentPlayer` + `ready` both via `useSyncExternalStore`; `setCurrentPlayer`/`clearCurrentPlayer` write localStorage and dispatch `player-identity-changed`
- ✅ PlayerPicker: players from squad profile + lastGameDates derived via `useSyncExternalStore` + `useMemo`
- ✅ insights/page: `mounted` flag replaced with `useSyncExternalStore(() => () => {}, () => true, () => false)`
- ✅ player/page, games, games/[gameId], performance, review: saved matches read as JSON snapshot via `useSyncExternalStore`; all derived values in `useMemo`
- ✅ All unused-var warnings cleared: removed dead imports/functions from capture, stub params from blog/slug and players/[playerId]
- ✅ `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning in capture silenced with eslint-disable for the intentionally omitted `startPushToTalkRecording` dep

---

### Batch U (April 2026) — Constructive coaching plans
- ✅ `playerCoachingPlan.ts` added — `buildPlayerCoachingPlan(row)` derives what went well, a main focus area, and up to 4 next-week targets from a `ReportRow`
- ✅ Player Home (`/player`) upgraded from stub to Live — shows latest match coaching plan below season averages
- ✅ Game Detail (`/player/games/[gameId]`) — per-game coaching plan shown after stats
- ✅ Compare (`/player/compare`) — coaching plan shown only for the currently selected player (own player only; privacy rule enforced)
- ✅ Review (`/player/review`) — unscoped match-level notes removed; clips section retained; page describes why notes are hidden
- ✅ Player privacy rule documented in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

---

### Batch V (April 2026) — Blog
- ✅ `blogData.tsx` — shared post data: `BlogPost` type, JSX content, two seed posts
- ✅ `/blog` — index listing: marquee ticker header, hero panel, post cards (tag, date, reading time, link), CTA section
- ✅ `/blog/[slug]` — individual post: breadcrumb nav, article header, JSX body, JSON-LD structured data, `generateStaticParams`, post-article CTA
- ✅ Seed post 1: "Why We Built FYNL Whistle" — Sunday-evening spreadsheet problem, voice-tagging workflow, beta status
- ✅ Seed post 2: "What Good Coaching Feedback Actually Looks Like" — Specific → Contextual → Forward-looking structure, callout examples, lineout example, data as enabler

---

### Batch W (April 2026) — Player settings page
- ✅ `/player/settings` upgraded from stub to Live — proper polished settings page matching the SaaS design language
- ✅ Profile card — avatar initial circle, full name, "known as", position pills, status badge, voice nicknames
- ✅ Playing As — current player display with "Change player" button (`clearCurrentPlayer()`)
- ✅ Display — colour scheme toggle (`ThemeSchemeToggle`)
- ✅ Local data — `useSyncExternalStore` reads squad profile (team name, player count) and saved matches count; updates reactively on `player-identity-changed` event
- ✅ Navigate — 2-column grid of quick-link cards to Home, Games, Performance, Team Analytics

---

### Batch X (April 2026) — Custom KPIs, Help System, AI Chat, QA Polish
- ✅ **Custom KPI Targets** (`app/coach/team-setup/KpiTargetsSection.tsx`) — new section on Team Setup with two parts: (1) Performance Thresholds: adjust Dominant/Competitive/Below values for 6 built-in KPIs; (2) Manual Tracking KPIs: add/edit/delete coach-defined metrics. Stored as `kpiTargets?: CustomKpiConfig[]` on `SquadProfile`
- ✅ **New types** (`app/rugby-tagging/lib/squadProfile.ts`) — `BuiltinKpiTarget`, `ManualKpi`, `CustomKpiConfig`, `DEFAULT_BUILTIN_TARGETS` (6 presets); `gradeWithCustomThreshold()` added to `helpers.ts`
- ✅ **Insights custom thresholds** — Insights KPI cards read coach-set thresholds; Manual KPIs shown as reference cards in a new "Custom Tracking KPIs" section
- ✅ **PageHelp** (`app/components/PageHelp.tsx`) — `?` button on every page (16 pages); opens a client-side modal with page-specific steps and tips. Content in `app/coach/help-content.ts` and `app/player/help-content.ts`
- ✅ **FloatingHelpChat** (`app/components/FloatingHelpChat.tsx`) — bottom-right persistent chat button on all coach/player pages; slide-up panel with streaming AI responses. API route: `/api/help-chat/route.ts` (gpt-4o-mini, streaming `ReadableStream`)
- ✅ **Trend indicators** on Insights KPI cards — `↑/↓ X% vs prev` via new `TrendArrow.tsx` component; `kpiDeltas` useMemo compares last 2 matches
- ✅ **Key Takeaways box** on Insights Overview — rules-based bullets (colour-coded green/amber) before the KPI grid
- ✅ **Season at a Glance** on Coach Home — 4-stat strip (matches, avg tackle %, tries for/against, try margin) shown when 2+ matches saved
- ✅ **Grade trend + Focus Areas chips** on Player Home — `↑/↓` vs previous match next to GradeBadge; amber chips for Below/Poor metric grades
- ✅ **Visual polish** — `.card-hover` CSS utility in `globals.css`; quick-link descriptions updated to be instructional; button hover lifts throughout

---

### Batch Y (April 2026) — Supabase Auth
- ✅ `@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr` installed
- ✅ `lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser) + `lib/supabase/server.ts` (server, async cookies)
- ✅ `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 replacement for middleware.ts) — session refresh on every request; `/coach/*` → 307 to `/login` if no session; `/api/transcribe` + `/api/help-chat` → 401 if no session
- ✅ `/login` and `/signup` pages — email/password, dark-themed, FYNL Whistle logo; check-email confirmation state on signup
- ✅ `app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts` — exchanges email confirmation code for session, redirects to `/coach`
- ✅ `app/coach/layout.tsx` — server-side auth guard (redirect to `/login` if no user)
- ✅ Marketing header `LoginDropdown` — auth-aware: "Sign in" + "Try free" when logged out, "Dashboard" when logged in

**Supabase project:** `lkobjxhmuuisbtsmgwwt.supabase.co`
**Tech note:** Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`; export function `middleware` → `proxy`

---

### Batch Z, Part 1 (April 2026) — Cloud Squad Profile
- ✅ `public.squad_profiles` Supabase table planned for manual SQL setup — one row per coach (`user_id` unique), JSONB profile arrays, RLS own-row select/insert/update policies
- ✅ `lib/squadProfileCloud.ts` — browser Supabase helpers for fetch/upsert plus `mergeSquadProfiles()`; maps DB snake_case rows to `SquadProfile` camelCase and silently no-ops on cloud errors
- ✅ `app/coach/SyncSquadProfile.tsx` — client-only coach layout sync: localStorage read, cloud fetch, newest `updatedAt` wins, tie goes to cloud, winner saved locally and pushed up if cloud is absent/stale
- ✅ `app/coach/layout.tsx` — renders `<SyncSquadProfile />` inside the authenticated coach shell before the sidebar
- ✅ `saveSquadProfile()` now remains localStorage-first and fire-and-forget upserts to Supabase via dynamic import; no call sites changed
- ✅ Verification: `npm run lint` passed with existing warning only; `npm run build` passed

---

### Batch Z, Part 2 (April 2026) — Cloud Data Foundation
- ✅ Tracked Supabase SQL added at `supabase/migrations/20260427000000_cloud_data_foundation.sql` for `squad_profiles`, `saved_matches`, indexes, and RLS own-row policies
- ✅ `lib/savedMatchesCloud.ts` added — browser Supabase helpers for fetch/upsert/delete plus `mergeSavedMatches()` newest-`updatedAt` conflict resolution
- ✅ `app/coach/SyncSavedMatches.tsx` added — authenticated coach shell merges local/cloud saved matches and backfills stale or missing cloud rows
- ✅ `savedMatches.ts` remains localStorage-first and now fire-and-forget upserts/deletes cloud records without blocking the UI
- ✅ Saved Matches delete now removes local data immediately and requests cloud deletion in the background
- ✅ Stale no-account/no-cloud copy updated across coach settings/help, help chat, saved matches, coach home, compare, and marketing/about/blog CTAs
- ✅ Video remained out of scope for Part 2: clips/annotations sync as match metadata; file storage landed in Part 3

### Batch Z, Part 3 (April 2026) — Cloud Video, Team Invites, Player Sync
- ✅ Cloud sync helpers added: `syncAllLocalMatchesToCloud()` and `syncLocalSquadProfileToCloud()` power automatic sync and the Coach Settings "Sync Now" panel
- ✅ Supabase Storage migration added for private `match-videos` bucket plus `saved_matches.video_storage_path`; `lib/matchVideoCloud.ts` handles upload progress, signed URLs, and deletion helper
- ✅ Capture video uploads now queue until a match ID exists, then save `videoStoragePath` on the saved match record. Original implementation used Supabase Storage; Batch AO superseded it with Cloudflare R2.
- ✅ Coach Review, Player Review, and Player Game Detail can fall back to signed cloud video URLs when no local blob URL exists
- ✅ Team invite migration added for `team_members` and `invite_tokens` with RLS for coach ownership and accepted-member read access to squad profiles, saved matches, and coach videos
- ✅ Invite flow added: `/api/invite`, `/api/invite/redeem`, `/invite/accept`, token-aware `/login` and `/signup`, and auth callback redemption after email confirmation
- ✅ `/coach/team` added with player/coach invite form, optional coach labels (Head / Forwards / Backs / 2nd team / custom), optional head-coach permissions for invited coaches, squad-player linking, member list, revoke action, editable team name, and Coach sidebar link
- ✅ Invite creation falls back to the legacy `team_members` payload if production Supabase is missing `coach_label` / `can_manage_team`; invite still sends, but labels/head permissions require migrations `20260427000003` and `20260427000004`
- ✅ Player auth identity now syncs through `SyncPlayerData`: accepted player members auto-set `rugby-player-selected-id`, fetch the coach's squad profile and saved matches, and skip manual player picking
- ✅ Cloud write guards added so only head coach/data-owner accounts upsert or delete saved matches and squad profiles; player and assistant accounts read shared data only
- ✅ Server-only `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` support added for safely writing `SquadPlayer.linkedUserId` back to the coach-owned squad profile after invite acceptance
- ✅ Verification: `git diff --check`, `npm run lint`, and production `npm run build` passed after wrapping query-param auth pages in Suspense for Next 16

---

### Batch AA (April 2026) — Review set-piece tags
- ✅ Shared `setPieceReview.ts` helper derives read-only review moments from saved scrum and lineout tags
- ✅ Coach Review now shows auto-generated Set-piece tags beside the clip playlist, split by Scrum / Lineout with Own / Opposition checkbox filters
- ✅ Player Review shows the same set-piece tags per match alongside coach clips, using the same filters and seek-to-video behaviour when a video is available
- ✅ Manual clips remain unchanged; set-piece tags are generated from match events and are not persisted as new clips
- ✅ Verification: `git diff --check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` passed

### Batch AB (April 2026) — Video upload finalising state
- ✅ Capture video upload status now distinguishes bytes sent from confirmed cloud storage: 100% displays as "Finalising cloud save..." until the saved match has `videoStoragePath`
- ✅ Direct Supabase Storage uploads now time out while finalising and retry through the Supabase client fallback instead of leaving the UI stuck at 100%
- ✅ Completion signal remains "Synced to cloud"; if both upload paths fail, the capture page shows the returned storage error

---

### Batch AD (April 2026) — Video upload and cross-account streaming fixes

Two implementation bugs that blocked reliable video upload and cross-account playback:

**Bug 1 (upload timeout):** XHR upload timeout was hardcoded to 120 s — any video larger than ~500 MB at typical home internet speeds would always fail silently. Fixed by setting `DIRECT_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS = 0` (unlimited); the browser still fires `error` events on genuine network failures.

**Bug 2 (signed URL expiry with no recovery):** All three playback pages requested signed URLs with a 4-hour expiry and had no `onError` handler. An expired or failed cloud URL would silently break the video element with no recovery path. Fixed by increasing expiry to 24 hours and wiring `onError` refresh on all three `<video>` elements.

- ✅ `lib/matchVideoCloud.ts` — upload timeout set to 0 (unlimited); `SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 86400` exported as shared constant; `refreshVideoSignedUrl()` exported for use by all playback pages
- ✅ `app/coach/review/page.tsx` — signed URL expiry updated to 24 hr; `onError` re-fetches a fresh cloud URL when the current one expires; loading hint suppressed while cloud fetch is in flight; "unavailable" vs "not-yet-loaded" states distinguished
- ✅ `app/player/review/page.tsx` — 24 hr expiry; per-match loading spinner while cloud URL is fetching; `onError` re-fetches fresh URL per match
- ✅ `app/player/games/[gameId]/page.tsx` — 24 hr expiry; loading spinner while cloud fetch is in flight; `onError` re-fetches on failure
- ✅ Cross-account video access already correctly enabled by RLS (migration 20260427000002 "Team member can read coach videos" policy) — no schema changes needed
- ✅ Verification: `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` passed

**Video stack (current):**
- Storage: Cloudflare R2 private bucket, object key `{owner_user_id}/{match_id}/{timestamp}-{uuid}-{filename}`
- Upload: browser XHR direct to an R2 signed PUT URL from `/api/match-video/upload-url`, head-coach only
- Playback: R2 signed GET URLs from `/api/match-video/signed-url`, 24 hr expiry, auto-refresh on error
- Delete: `/api/match-video/delete` removes the R2 object when replacing a video or deleting a saved match
- Access control: Supabase auth/team membership checked by server route before issuing any R2 signed URL. Accepted team members can read videos in their coach owner's folder; only coaches with `can_manage_team` can upload/delete.
- No transcoding — raw video file served via HTTP range requests (adequate for private beta)

**Cloudflare R2 setup required:**
1. Create a private R2 bucket, e.g. `fynl-whistle-match-videos`.
2. Create an R2 API token with object read/write permissions for that bucket.
3. Add Vercel env vars: `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`.
4. Configure bucket CORS to allow the production origin `https://fynlwhistle.com` and local dev origin `http://localhost:3000` with methods `GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`; allowed headers should include `content-type`; expose headers should include `etag`, `content-length`, `content-range`, `accept-ranges`.
5. Redeploy after env vars are set. Settings → Cloud sync will warn if R2 env vars are missing.

**Why not Cloudflare Stream:** R2 removes the Supabase free-tier upload cap with the smallest architecture change. Cloudflare Stream adds transcoding/HLS/CDN but requires a deeper migration to video IDs and Stream playback. Revisit when: >50 hrs of stored video, mobile adaptive streaming needed, or raw-file playback becomes unreliable.

### Batch AO (April 2026) — Cloudflare R2 match video storage

- ✅ `lib/matchVideoCloud.ts` now uses app server routes for R2 signed upload/playback/delete URLs instead of Supabase Storage.
- ✅ Server-only R2 signer added in `lib/r2.ts`; no R2 credentials are exposed to the browser.
- ✅ New routes: `/api/match-video/upload-url`, `/api/match-video/signed-url`, `/api/match-video/delete`, `/api/match-video/config`.
- ✅ Object keys use `{owner_user_id}/{match_id}/{timestamp}-{uuid}-{sanitized_filename}` and continue to be stored in existing `SavedMatchRecord.videoStoragePath` / `saved_matches.video_storage_path`.
- ✅ Security model: Supabase session + team membership decide access before issuing R2 signed URLs. Players/accepted members can read owner-folder videos; only `can_manage_team` coaches can upload/delete.
- ✅ Local browser video behaviour is unchanged: Capture still uses the selected file's blob URL immediately, then uploads in the background.
- ✅ Saved match deletion and video replacement now request R2 object deletion in the background and log clear delete errors.
- ✅ `lib/cloudHealth.ts` no longer probes Supabase Storage; Settings checks whether R2 env vars are configured.
- ⚠ Existing Supabase Storage video objects are not automatically copied. To preserve old cloud playback, copy objects from Supabase `match-videos` into R2 using the same `videoStoragePath` keys.

---

### Batch AC (April 2026) — Cloud sync error surfacing and schema diagnostics

Root cause of all cross-device sync failures identified and fixed: all 5 Supabase migrations were unapplied in production, and every cloud error was silently swallowed so Settings always showed "Synced" even when nothing reached the database.

- ✅ `lib/savedMatchesCloud.ts` — all functions now return `{ ok, error? }` / `{ records, error? }` / `{ count, errors[] }` instead of void/null; errors are surfaced to callers
- ✅ `lib/squadProfileCloud.ts` — same error-surfacing pattern applied to all functions
- ✅ `lib/teamContext.ts` — no longer permanently caches `null` on a transient JS exception; a failed lookup retries next call
- ✅ `lib/cloudHealth.ts` (new) — probes `squad_profiles`, `saved_matches`, `team_members`, `video_storage_path` column, and video storage readiness; Batch AO updated this to check R2 env configuration instead of the old Supabase Storage bucket.
- ✅ `app/coach/SyncSavedMatches.tsx` — dispatches `rugbycoach-cloud-sync-error` CustomEvent when background sync fails so Settings can surface it without a manual click
- ✅ `app/coach/SyncSquadProfile.tsx` — updated to use new `{ profile }` destructured return from `fetchCloudSquadProfile`
- ✅ `app/player/SyncPlayerData.tsx` — membership and fetch errors now logged to `console.error` with `[SyncPlayerData]` prefix for Vercel/devtools visibility
- ✅ `app/coach/settings/page.tsx` — "Sync Now" shows "Sync failed" with error text when any write fails; amber schema warning panel when tables/columns/bucket are missing; new "Check Cloud" diagnostic button shows live user ID, local match count, and cloud match count; `clearTeamContextCache()` called on sync and sign-out; `useEffect` added for schema check on mount and sync-error event listener
- ✅ `upsertCloudSavedMatch` gracefully retries without `video_storage_path` if migration 001 column is absent (error code `42703`)
- ✅ Production Supabase: all 5 migrations applied manually via SQL editor; `saved_matches`, `squad_profiles`, `team_members`, `invite_tokens` tables live with correct RLS; `match-videos` bucket created
- ✅ Verification: `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` passed, deployed to Vercel

---

---

### Batch AE (April 2026) — Full codebase audit, cleanup and QA pass

Full audit of all 50 routes, code quality sweep, and safe cleanup pass. Build and lint clean throughout.

**Cleaned up:**
- ✅ Removed 5 orphaned redirect-stub directories (`/game-review`, `/squad`, `/team-dashboard`, `/player-dashboard`, `/saved-matches`) — legacy stubs left over from architecture migration; routes dropped from 50 → 45
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `createClient` import alias in `app/coach/settings/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added `typecheck` script to `package.json` (`tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Removed 5 unused default Next.js SVGs from `public/`
- ✅ Verification: `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` clean (45 routes, 0 TypeScript errors)

**Flagged but not changed (risks for next stage):**
- No `middleware.ts` — auth protection is client-side only; admin and coach routes have no server-side auth guard
- Admin pages render as static (○) — should be dynamic with server-side auth check
- `app/coach/capture/page.tsx` is 3,445 lines — maintenance risk as feature grows
- No automated test suite
- Stripe checkout is wired for USD Team Launch and Club 5; GBP/AUD/EUR price IDs remain `"price_TODO"` until those Stripe prices are created
- Contact form not wired to any backend
- `public/` is now empty — no brand logo or open graph images

**Architectural decisions raised:**
1. **Video file size limit** — resolved in Batch AO by moving new match video upload/playback/delete flows from Supabase Storage to Cloudflare R2 signed URLs. Existing saved match records keep `videoStoragePath`; old Supabase-hosted objects require manual migration to R2 if they need continued cloud playback.
2. **Invite flow redesign** — current email-based invite depends on Resend domain verification and direct delivery. Agreed to redesign as link-based flow: coach generates shareable link → anyone signs up via link → picks their player from squad list or creates one → coach approves. See next steps below.

---

### Batch AF (April 2026) — Rebrand to FYNL Whistle

- ✅ All "RugbyCoach" text replaced with "FYNL Whistle" across all 20 affected files
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` updated to `https://fynlwhistle.com` — invite links now generate correct public URLs
- ✅ Email sender updated to `FYNL Whistle <noreply@fynlwhistle.com>` (Resend domain verification for fynlwhistle.com still needed)
- ✅ localStorage and CustomEvent keys migrated: `rugbycoach-*` → `fynlwhistle-*` across `ThemeSchemeToggle`, `SyncSavedMatches`, and `settings/page.tsx`
- ✅ "Private beta" labels removed from all layouts, sidebars, marquees, and CTAs; replaced with "Live" / "Now live" / "Free to use"
- ✅ Blog post slug updated: `why-we-built-rugbycoach` → `why-we-built-fynl-whistle`
- ✅ AI system prompts (help-chat route + FloatingHelpChat) updated to reference FYNL Whistle
- ✅ JSON-LD structured data on blog posts updated (author/publisher name)
- ✅ PROJECT_CONTEXT.md updated throughout

**Note:** Existing users will have their theme preference reset (localStorage key changed). Resend email sending requires `fynlwhistle.com` domain verification with SPF/DKIM/DMARC DNS records before invite emails will send reliably.

---

### Batch AG (April 2026) — Link-based invite system, auth hardening, edge guards

- ✅ **Link-based invite system** — replaces email-only invites with shareable join links
  - `/coach/team` — coach generates a join link (no email required); pending approval queue with accept/reject per row
  - `/invite/join` + `JoinForm.tsx` — full unauthenticated join journey: view link → sign up/log in → pick squad player or self-add → pending state
  - `join_token` threaded through login, signup, and auth callback so email-confirm flow lands back on the join page
  - API routes added: `POST/DELETE /api/invite/link`, `GET/POST /api/invite/join`, `POST /api/invite/approve`, `POST /api/invite/reject`
  - `lib/teamMembersCloud.ts` — extended with link invite helpers
  - Supabase migration `20260427000005_link_invites.sql` — `team_invite_links` table with RLS
  - Existing email invite flow (`/api/invite`) retained and updated: now returns `500` when Resend is not configured instead of silently succeeding (prevents false-positive "invite sent" UX)
- ✅ **Auth hardening — player and admin layouts** — `/player/layout.tsx` and `/admin/layout.tsx` now have server-side auth guards that redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`; admin additionally gates on `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var allowlist
- ✅ **Edge auth guard extended** — `proxy.ts` matcher and redirect guard extended to cover `/player/*` and `/admin/*` in addition to `/coach/*`; all three platform areas now protected at both edge and layout level

---

### Batch AH (April 2026) — Invite link anon RLS fix

- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20260429000000_fix_invite_link_anon_rls.sql` — adds two missing anon SELECT policies
- ✅ `team_invite_links` anon SELECT policy — unauthenticated users (new browser, no session) can now look up a link by token; previously RLS blocked the query and the join page always showed "INVALID LINK"
- ✅ `squad_profiles` anon SELECT policy — unauthenticated join page can now display the team name ("Join Northside RFC") instead of falling back to "You've been invited"
- No application code changes — page and API logic was already correct; root cause was the missing `to anon` policy on the table

---

### Batch AI (April 2026) — Email confirmation redirect fix + forgot password

- ✅ **Email confirmation redirect** — root cause identified: Supabase dashboard Site URL was still `localhost:3000` and `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback` was not in the Redirect URLs allowlist, so Supabase ignored the `emailRedirectTo` value and redirected to localhost. Fix: set Site URL to `https://fynlwhistle.com` and add `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback` (+ wildcard variant) to Redirect URLs in Supabase Auth settings. Also confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://fynlwhistle.com` is set in Vercel Production env vars (`.env.local` is local-only).
- ✅ **Forgot password link** — "Forgot password?" link added inline with the Password label on `/login`
- ✅ `app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` — new page: user enters email, calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` with `redirectTo: .../auth/callback?next=/reset-password`; shows "Check your email" confirmation state regardless of whether the address exists (avoids enumeration)
- ✅ `app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` — new page: enter + confirm new password, calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })`; guards against no-session state (redirects to `/forgot-password?error=expired`); redirects to `/coach` on success
- ✅ Existing auth callback at `app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts` required no changes — already handles `?next=` redirects

**Supabase dashboard actions required (one-time manual steps):**
1. Auth → URL Configuration → Site URL: `https://fynlwhistle.com`
2. Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs: add `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback` and `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback?*`
3. Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://fynlwhistle.com` (Production)

---

### Batch AK (April 2026) — Dark mode premium refresh

- ✅ `app/globals.css` token-only update — no component changes
- ✅ `--foreground-strong` → `#ffffff` (pure white headings, Linear/Vercel feel)
- ✅ `--accent` → `#3b8ef0` (vivid blue, replaces muted cool-grey)
- ✅ `--success / --warning / --danger` brightened (`#4ade80` / `#fbbf24` / `#f87171`) — status colours now pop
- ✅ Panel depth increased: `--background` / `--panel` / `--panel-2` / `--panel-3` darkened and differentiated
- ✅ Border contrast improved (`--border` / `--border-light` sharper)
- ✅ Shadows deepened (`--shadow-soft` / `--shadow-panel` now `rgba(0,0,0,0.45/0.35)`)
- ✅ Focus glow ring upgraded: `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(59,142,240,0.18)` on all inputs/selects/textareas
- ✅ Body radial gradient: faint blue accent glow at top instead of white

---

### Batch AJ (April 2026) — Quick UX wins

- ✅ **A: Match switcher on Insights** — `selectedMatchId` state + `<select>` dropdown in page header; only shown when 2+ saved matches exist; switching shows full analytics for the chosen match without leaving the page; `effectiveMatchId = selectedMatchId ?? currentMatchId` falls back to current active match
- ✅ **B: Match + player picker on Players page** — `useSyncExternalStore` for saved matches added to Players page; `selectedMatchId` state drives roster and events via `useMemo`; match `<select>` dropdown shown above player picker when 2+ matches saved; switching match resets player selection to first player in that match
- ✅ **C: Skip button on TeamSheetModal** — `onSkip?: () => void` prop added; "Skip for now" button (muted style, left-aligned) rendered when prop provided; `capture/page.tsx` passes `onSkip={() => setShowTeamSheetModal(false)}`
- ✅ **D: Show/hide password toggle** — `showPassword` state + eye SVG button added to `/login` and `/signup`; `tabIndex={-1}` so it doesn't interrupt keyboard flow
- ✅ **E: Account section on Coach Settings** — logged-in email fetched on mount from `supabase.auth.getUser()`; shown in Account section above sign-out; "Change password" button calls `resetPasswordForEmail()` and shows inline "Check your email" confirmation

---

### Batch AL (April 2026) — PDF match report

- ✅ `@react-pdf/renderer` installed as new dependency
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/lib/exports/matchReportPdf.tsx` — A4 portrait PDF document component; sections: FYNL Whistle header + match title/date/opponent, 8-KPI grid (tackle%, tries for/against, penalties, lineout%, scrum%, carries, turnovers), game coaching comment + game flow summary, top performers + needs attention players, full colour-coded player stats table (T/MT/C/TO/Tackle%/Grade/Comment), footer
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/lib/exports/downloadPdf.ts` — browser download helper mirroring `downloadWorkbook.ts`
- ✅ `app/coach/insights/page.tsx` — "Export PDF" button added next to existing "Export Report" button in page header; dynamically imports PDF generator so `@react-pdf/renderer` stays out of SSR bundle; shows "Generating…" loading state during export

---

### Batch AM (April 2026) — Stripe checkout foundation

- ✅ `stripe` SDK installed
- ✅ `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts` — authenticated Stripe Checkout session endpoint for subscription mode with 14-day trial; returns `401` for logged-out users, validates missing/TODO price IDs, and falls back to request origin if `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is missing
- ✅ `app/(marketing)/pricing/PricingExperience.tsx` — Team Launch and Club 5 CTAs now call `/api/stripe/checkout`; unauthenticated users fall back to login; invalid placeholder prices fail safely; Organisation remains a contact/demo CTA
- ✅ `app/(marketing)/pricing/pricingConfig.ts` — test-mode Stripe Price IDs added for Team Launch and Club 5; each Price has manual currency options for USD, AUD, EUR, and GBP:
  - Team Launch monthly: `price_1TRsWbQL0gCVdJZirakOuwQY`
  - Team Launch yearly: `price_1TRsZDQL0gCVdJZit1TBHsuS`
  - Club 5 monthly: `price_1TRsb9QL0gCVdJZiCwAZYVx2`
  - Club 5 yearly: `price_1TRsbAQL0gCVdJZiMeFb2sv0`
- ✅ `app/coach/page.tsx` — `/coach?checkout=success` shows a dismissible trial-started banner and cleans the URL
- ✅ Vercel Production `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` configured with the matching Stripe test-mode secret key
- ✅ End-to-end test checkout verified in Stripe sandbox: pricing CTA → login/session → Stripe Checkout → trial checkout flow
- ✅ Verification: `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` clean

**Still required before full production payments:**
- Create live-mode Stripe Prices with the same manual currency options, then replace the four test-mode `price_...` IDs in `pricingConfig.ts`
- Switch Vercel Production `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to the matching `sk_live_...` key only when live price IDs are in place
- Optional later batch: add Stripe webhook + subscription table if/when access needs to be gated by active subscription status

---

### Batch AN (April 2026) — Production email reliability

- ✅ `app/api/invite/route.ts` — direct coach invite emails now inspect the Resend SDK `{ error }` response and return `502` if Resend rejects the send, preventing a false-positive "Invite sent" UI state.
- ✅ Sender remains `FYNL Whistle <noreply@fynlwhistle.com>`.
- ✅ DNS inspection confirms `fynlwhistle.com` nameservers are Vercel (`ns1.vercel-dns.com`, `ns2.vercel-dns.com`).
- ✅ DNS inspection confirms existing Resend-style records:
  - `send.fynlwhistle.com` TXT: `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`
  - `send.fynlwhistle.com` MX: `10 feedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com`
  - `resend._domainkey.fynlwhistle.com` TXT: DKIM public key present
- ⚠️ DNS inspection found no `_dmarc.fynlwhistle.com` TXT record yet; add `v=DMARC1; p=none;` in Vercel DNS for the first monitoring pass.
- ⚠️ Manual dashboard steps still required:
  - Resend → Domains → verify `fynlwhistle.com` until status is `verified`.
  - Vercel → DNS → add missing `_dmarc` TXT if not already added.
  - Supabase Auth → URL Configuration → confirm Site URL `https://fynlwhistle.com` and redirect URLs `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback` plus `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback?*`.
  - Supabase Auth → SMTP / Custom SMTP → enable Resend SMTP: host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465` SSL/TLS or `587` STARTTLS, username `resend`, password `RESEND_API_KEY`, sender email `noreply@fynlwhistle.com`, sender name `FYNL Whistle`.
  - Vercel Production env vars → confirm `RESEND_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://fynlwhistle.com`.
- Production smoke tests to run after manual dashboard/DNS steps:
  - `/coach/team` direct invite email arrives from `FYNL Whistle <noreply@fynlwhistle.com>` and opens `https://fynlwhistle.com/invite/accept?...`.
  - Fresh signup confirmation email arrives through Supabase/Resend SMTP and redirects to production, not localhost.
  - Password reset email arrives and opens `https://fynlwhistle.com/auth/callback?next=/reset-password`.

### Batch AP (May 2026) — Player invite claim + team access admin controls

- ✅ Email player invites now stay player-scoped through signup/login instead of falling back to coach onboarding/dashboard.
- ✅ `/invite/accept` now shows authenticated player invitees a player-claim screen where they can choose their squad profile or create a basic new player profile if missing.
- ✅ Invite redemption is centralized through `lib/inviteServer.ts`; `/api/invite/redeem` accepts optional `playerSquadId` / `displayName`, links existing players, or creates and links a new active player.
- ✅ Player picker layout widened into a full player-app page with responsive grid cards instead of a narrow centered list.
- ✅ Coach Team Access now shows joined/invited/request counts and per-member admin actions: change pending invite email, resend invite, send password reset to joined members, and revoke access.
- ✅ Revoking a player member now also unlinks that user from the squad player record.
- ✅ Verification: `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` passed.

### Batch AR (May 2026) — Dashboard rebuild (fixtures, training, availability, AI chat)

- ✅ Coach dashboard rebuilt with: next fixture card, this week's training sessions, availability response summary, post-session check-in card, and embedded AI coaching chat
- ✅ `Fixture`, `TrainingSession`, `AvailabilityResponse`, `SessionLog` types added to `app/rugby-tagging/types.ts`
- ✅ `SquadProfile` extended with `fixtures?`, `trainingSessions?`, `availabilityResponses?`, `sessionLogs?`, `leaguePosition?`
- ✅ `/coach/team-setup` extended with fixture management (add/edit/delete) and recurring training session management (add by day-of-week, time, location)
- ✅ `/player/availability` added — player availability picker for upcoming fixtures and training sessions
- ✅ `DashboardChat.tsx` — embedded AI assistant chat in coach dashboard using streaming GPT-4o-mini responses with squad context injected
- ✅ `app/api/help-chat/route.ts` — context-aware streaming chat endpoint with full FYNL Whistle system prompt
- ✅ **Cloud sync fix** — `lib/squadProfileCloud.ts` updated to map all new fields (`fixtures`, `training_sessions`, `availability_responses`, `session_logs`, `league_position`) to/from Supabase; these fields were missing from the original sync code so data was only stored in localStorage
- ✅ Migration `supabase/migrations/20260501000000_squad_profile_new_fields.sql` — adds the 5 new columns to `squad_profiles`

**Manual SQL step required:** Run `supabase/migrations/20260501000000_squad_profile_new_fields.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor to add the new columns before the sync will work.

### Batch AQ (May 2026) — Personal player invite copy + role guards

- ✅ Player email invite landing is now personalized with invited player, coach, and team context where available.
- ✅ Wrong-account invite opens now show a clear “this invite is for…” state with a sign-out/continue action instead of letting the coach session muddle the flow.
- ✅ Player invite signup hides the coach name field, locks the invited email, and stores player-safe metadata instead of `coach_name`.
- ✅ Player invite login locks the invited email and points wrong-email users back to the invite flow.
- ✅ Auth callback returns unresolved invite confirmations to `/invite/accept` instead of falling back to `/coach`.
- ✅ Server-side role guards redirect accepted players away from `/coach` to `/player`, and accepted assistant coaches away from `/player` to `/coach`.
- ✅ Verification: `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` passed.

### Batch AY (May 2026) — Player page data fix: RLS + playerId on RosterRow

Two-part fix for player pages (Home, Games, Performance) silently showing empty data.

**Fix 1 — Supabase RLS:** `squad_profiles` and `saved_matches` SELECT policies only allowed the coach (owner) to read their own rows. Players querying via `SyncPlayerData` got empty results with no error. Added migration `20260501000003_player_read_access.sql` with a `can_read_team_data()` helper function and new SELECT policies allowing any accepted team member to read their coach's data.

**Fix 2 — playerId on RosterRow:** All player-page match filtering used exact string equality (`r.name === player.fullName`). Any name mismatch (nickname, capitalisation, abbreviation) caused silent zero matches. Added `playerId?: string` to `RosterRow` and `ReportRow`; resolved at roster entry time (team sheet paste and inline name edits in Capture); all player-page filtering now checks ID first with name fallback.

- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20260501000003_player_read_access.sql` — `can_read_team_data()` function + SELECT policies for squad_profiles and saved_matches
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/types.ts` — `playerId?` added to `RosterRow` and `ReportRow`
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/helpers.ts` — `hydrateRosterRows` preserves playerId; `parseTeamSheetText` accepts `squadPlayers?` and resolves IDs; `buildReportRowsFromMatch` propagates playerId to ReportRow
- ✅ `app/coach/capture/page.tsx` — `updateRosterRow` resolves playerId on name change; `parseTeamSheetText` calls pass squad players
- ✅ `app/player/page.tsx`, `games/page.tsx`, `performance/page.tsx`, `compare/page.tsx`, `games/[gameId]/page.tsx` — ID-first matching with name fallback throughout; game detail page uses roster name for event filtering

**Manual step required:** Run `supabase/migrations/20260501000003_player_read_access.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.

### Batch AZ (May 2026) — Video loading 403 fix + R2 path organisation

**Fix — Video access 403 ("You do not have access to this match video"):**

Root cause: `getServerTeamContext()` resolved `ownerUserId` from the `team_members` table. If the coach also has an accepted membership in another team, `ownerUserId` returned that other team's coach ID — not their own — causing the ownership check to fail for their own videos.

Added `userId: string` to `MyTeamContext` (the authenticated user's own stable auth ID, always `user.id`). Video ownership checks now use this correctly:
- **Upload path** keyed on `ctx.userId` so coach videos always live under the uploader's own ID
- **Signed URL**: grants access if video owner matches `ctx.userId` (direct owner) **or** `ctx.ownerUserId` (team member accessing their coach's video)
- **Delete**: restricted to `ctx.userId` only — team members cannot delete the coach's videos

No DB migration required. Existing video paths (stored as `{coachId}/{matchId}/...`) remain valid — `isValidR2ObjectKey` requires ≥3 segments and the owner is still the first segment.

**Improvement — R2 path organisation:**

New uploads use a human-readable folder derived from the match title, opponent, and date instead of a raw `matchId` UUID. Example: `{userId}/round_2_vs_hunter_wildfires_18_04_2026/{timestamp-uuid}-recording.mp4`. Old paths are fully backward-compatible.

- ✅ `lib/teamContext.ts` — `userId` added to `MyTeamContext` type; both return paths in `getMyTeamContext()` include it
- ✅ `lib/serverTeamContext.ts` — both return paths include `userId: user.id`
- ✅ `app/api/match-video/upload-url/route.ts` — uses `ctx.userId` for path; accepts optional `matchTitle` in body
- ✅ `app/api/match-video/signed-url/route.ts` — checks `videoOwner !== ctx.userId && videoOwner !== ctx.ownerUserId`
- ✅ `app/api/match-video/delete/route.ts` — checks `videoOwner !== ctx.userId`
- ✅ `lib/r2.ts` — `createMatchVideoObjectKey` accepts optional `matchTitle`; falls back to sanitised `matchId`
- ✅ `lib/matchVideoCloud.ts` — `uploadMatchVideoWithResult` / `uploadMatchVideo` forward `matchTitle`
- ✅ `app/coach/capture/page.tsx` — composes `pathTitle` from matchTitle + opponent + matchDate and passes to upload

### Batch BA (May 2026) — Player dashboard rebuild + availability reasons

**AvailabilityResponse type extended:**
- `id: string` added (generated with `crypto.randomUUID()` on first write)
- `note?` renamed to `reason?` — free-text field populated only when `response === "unavailable"`
- `app/player/availability/page.tsx` updated to generate and preserve `id` in `upsertResponse`

**Player dashboard — `app/player/page.tsx` rebuilt:**
Full replacement of the minimal match-summary page with a proper six-section dashboard. All sections use `useSyncExternalStore` for storage reads (no `useEffect + setState`). Data sources: `subscribeSquadProfile` + `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` for team/availability data; `subscribeSavedMatchesChanged` + `SAVED_MATCHES_KEY` for match stats.

Sections:
1. **Header** — time-of-day greeting, team + position, amber badge counting unanswered events
2. **Availability** — upcoming fixtures + training sessions; fixtures use "Available/Unavailable/Maybe" labels, training uses "Going/Can't make it/Maybe"; tapping the negative option expands an inline reason input (not a modal); after Save the row shows the coloured response + "Change" link; available/maybe responses save immediately
3. **Season at a glance** — 4 metric cards: latest grade, tackle % with trend indicator, carries with season avg, games count
4. **Next game + last grade** — two-column row; left: next fixture from profile (date/opponent/home-away/time/days until); right: grade badge + last opponent + date, linked to `/player/games/[id]`
5. **Coach feedback** — left blue-border accent card; "What went well" + "Focus area" from `buildPlayerCoachingPlan()`
6. **Targets this week** — up to 3 targets from `coachingPlan.nextWeekTargets`; small blue dot + target text
7. **Stats last game** — table of tackles, missed tackles, carries, turnovers won, minutes; trend indicator per stat vs season average (↑ green / ↓ red / → muted)

**Coach dashboard — `app/coach/page.tsx` updated:**
- Next fixture details panel: "Can't make it" now lists each player individually with reason inline (`— "reason text"`)
- Training sessions this week: each row gets a "Details" toggle when any responses exist; breakdown shows Going/Can't make it (with reasons)/Maybe/No reply
- Upcoming fixtures list: same expandable "Details" per row with full player breakdown and reasons for unavailable players
- Two new state vars: `expandedFixtureId: string | null`, `expandedSessionId: string | null`

### Batch BB (May 2026) — Player game detail: involvement playlist fix + full-screen layout

**Bug fix — involvement playlist showing 0 events:**
Root cause: event resolution used a different lookup path than `buildBasicStats`. Player events were filtered using exact name matching, but roster entries used `playerName` from voice tags (which may not match `fullName`). Fixed by mirroring the same fuzzy-match and playerId resolution logic used in `buildBasicStats` throughout the event filter.

- ✅ `playerEvents()` function in `games/[gameId]/page.tsx` — resolves event's `playerName` against full roster via `findMatchingPlayer()` and applies ID-first + name-fallback matching to correctly attribute events to the current player
- ✅ Event text fallback — `event.text` used as secondary resolution source when `playerName` is absent or doesn't match

**Layout redesign — full-screen two-column:**
- ✅ Removed `max-w-3xl` single-column constraint from `app/player/games/[gameId]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Page is now `flex flex-col h-full overflow-hidden` — fills the full viewport within the sidebar layout
- ✅ Header (back link + match title + grade) pinned at the top, full width
- ✅ Left column (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`): video player, stats grid, set piece, coaching plan, footer note — scrolls independently
- ✅ Right column (`w-[360px] border-l overflow-y-auto`): involvement playlist — event list with no max-height cap, scrolls independently; Previous/Next buttons and current-clip card retained
- ✅ The `max-h-[460px]` scroll cap on the event list removed — right column itself is the scroll container

---

### Move 2 (May 2026) — Multi-tenant foundation: Organisation → Team model

Full migration from `squad_profiles` table to new `organisations` + `teams` schema.

- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20260503000000_multi_tenant_foundation.sql` — new `organisations` and `teams` tables replace `squad_profiles`; `teams` stores all JSONB arrays (players, fixtures, training_sessions, availability_responses, session_logs); RLS on all tables; `upsert_player_availability` RPC updated to use `p_team_id`
- ✅ `lib/teamCloud.ts` — new `fetchCloudTeam`, `upsertCloudTeam`, `upsertPlayerAvailabilityResponse`, `syncLocalTeamToCloud`, `mergeTeams`; maps `teams` DB rows to `Team` camelCase type; backwards-compat aliases retained
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/lib/team.ts` — `Team` type replaces `SquadProfile`; `getTeam`/`saveTeam`/`saveTeam` write to `TEAM_KEY` (`fynlwhistle-team`); one-time migration from old `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` on first read; deprecated aliases exported for gradual callsite migration
- ✅ `lib/teamContext.ts` — `getMyTeamContext` queries `team_members` for `team_id`, `role`, `can_manage_team`, and `created_by_user_id`; in-memory cache (CACHE_VERSION-gated); `clearTeamContextCache()` exported
- ✅ `app/player/SyncPlayerData.tsx` — replaces old squad-profile sync; fetches cloud team via `fetchCloudTeam`, merges local availability responses (newest wins), saves merged team to localStorage

---

### Batch BC (May 2026) — Coach admin permissions via invite link + player availability fix

**Coach admin permissions:**
- ✅ `app/coach/team/page.tsx` — "Grant admin" checkbox on coach invite form; encodes as `|admin` suffix in the invite link `label` field
- ✅ `app/api/invite/join/route.ts` — `parseCoachLabel` now reads three-part label (`name|title|admin`); writes `can_manage_team: true` to `team_members` on join
- ✅ `lib/teamMembersCloud.ts` — `updateMemberPermissions(memberId, canManageTeam)` added for runtime permission changes
- ✅ `app/api/team/member-permissions/route.ts` — new `POST` route; head-coach-only guard; validates member belongs to same team; blocks coaches removing their own permissions

**Player availability bug fix:**
- ✅ `app/player/availability/page.tsx` — fixed root cause of "No upcoming fixtures/training sessions": page was reading from deprecated `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` (deleted by migration) instead of `TEAM_KEY`; updated imports to use `TEAM_KEY`, `TEAM_CHANGED_EVENT`, `saveTeam`, and `Team` type directly
- ✅ `app/player/SyncPlayerData.tsx` — added `visibilitychange` listener so players re-sync team data from cloud when they return to the tab (mirrors existing coach behaviour)

---

### Bug fix (May 2026) — Coach dashboard and settings reading from stale localStorage key

- ✅ `app/coach/page.tsx` — dashboard was reading team profile from deprecated `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` (deleted by multi-tenant migration); switched to `TEAM_KEY`; updated `subscribeToStorage` to listen to `TEAM_CHANGED_EVENT` so dashboard re-renders once `SyncTeam` async cloud sync completes
- ✅ `app/coach/settings/page.tsx` — same root cause; replaced `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` with `TEAM_KEY` in `KNOWN_LOCAL_STORAGE_KEYS` array and `squadProfile` useMemo; Team tile now shows correct team name and player count

---

Batch BD (May 2026) — Move 2: Multi-tenant data model migration

New tables: organisations, organisation_members, user_profiles, stripe_events_processed
squad_profiles dropped; teams is the new primary team table with organisation_id
team_members reshaped: team_id, user_id, role enum, status enum
saved_matches migrated to team_id-based access; user_id renamed to created_by_user_id
All RLS policies rewritten around the new schema
Codebase rename: SquadProfile → Team, squadProfile.ts → team.ts, SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY → TEAM_KEY, SyncSquadProfile → SyncTeam
Three deprecated columns kept on team_members for transition safety: owner_user_id, member_user_id, can_manage_team. Dropped in Move 2.5.
Verified locally and on production; one user, one player, full data preserved.

---

### Bug fix (May 2026) — Set piece stats wrong + "Easts" hardcoded for all clubs

Two related bugs fixed:

1. **Stats bug (critical):** `buildSetPieceSummary` in `helpers.ts` was filtering with `setPieceSide !== undefined`, which included both own-ball and opposition set pieces. When opposition tagged "Won", it inflated the coach's own scrum/lineout success %. Fixed to filter only own-ball events.

2. **Multi-club naming:** `SetPieceSide` type was `"Easts" | "Opposition"` — all clubs saw "Easts" in the set piece dropdown regardless of their team name. Renamed internal value to `"Own" | "Opposition"`. Dropdown now shows the actual team name dynamically via a new `teamName` prop on `SetPieceLoggingPanel`.

- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/types.ts` — `SetPieceSide`: `"Easts"` → `"Own"`
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/helpers.ts` — `buildSetPieceSummary`: fixed filter, backward-compat for old `"Easts"` records
- ✅ `app/rugby-tagging/components/SetPieceLoggingPanel.tsx` — added `teamName` prop, dropdown shows team name for own-ball option
- ✅ `app/coach/capture/page.tsx` — default states, resets, voice parsing, AI text strings, `teamName` prop passed
- ✅ `app/coach/review/page.tsx` — filters already used `"Own"` (no change needed)
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20260503000002_fix_set_piece_side_own.sql` — converts stored `setPieceSide: "Easts"` → `"Own"` in `saved_matches.payload`

---

### Move 2.5 (May 2026) — Drop deprecated team_members columns

- ✅ `can_manage_team(p_team_id uuid)` RLS function rewritten to use `role = 'head_coach'` only — no longer reads the deprecated column
- ✅ `team_members.owner_user_id`, `member_user_id`, `can_manage_team` dropped (`supabase/migrations/20260505000000_move_2_5_cleanup.sql`)
- ✅ `invite_tokens` RLS policies "Coach can create/update own invite tokens" and "Invitee can mark own token used" rewritten — old versions referenced `owner_user_id`/`member_user_id` and were never updated by Move 2; now use `can_manage_team(tm.team_id)` and `tm.user_id` respectively
- ✅ Orphaned `team_invite_links` rows (null `team_id`, unresolvable via `owner_user_id`) deleted during migration
- ✅ `team_invite_links.team_id` enforced NOT NULL
- ✅ `lib/teamContext.ts`, `lib/serverTeamContext.ts` — SELECT drops `can_manage_team`; `canManageTeam` derived from `role === "head_coach"`
- ✅ `lib/teamMembersCloud.ts` — `TeamMemberRow` type updated; `rowToMember` derives `canManageTeam` from role
- ✅ `app/api/invite/join/route.ts`, `app/api/invite/notify-coach/route.ts` — removed `owner_user_id` and `can_manage_team` from `team_members` INSERT payloads
- ✅ `app/api/invite/resend/route.ts` — removed `can_manage_team` from type/SELECT; `formatCoachRoleLabel` simplified
- ✅ `app/api/team/member-permissions/route.ts` — now updates `role` (`head_coach`/`assistant_coach`) instead of the dropped boolean column
- ✅ `app/invite/join/page.tsx` — membership check migrated to `.eq("team_id", ...).eq("user_id", ...)`; fixed stale `"accepted"` status string → `"active"`

**Shipped:** Migration applied to production, code pushed and deployed to Vercel (commit 31b355a).

---

### Batch BE (May 2026) — Stripe webhook scaffold

- ✅ `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — POST handler with Stripe signature verification (`stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`)
- ✅ Idempotency via `stripe_events_processed` PK; duplicate events return 200 immediately
- ✅ Switch/dispatch pattern for event routing

---

### Batch BF (May 2026) — `checkout.session.completed` handler

- ✅ Creates new `organisations` row (plan, status=trialing, trial_ends_at, Stripe IDs) on first subscription checkout
- ✅ Creates `organisation_members` row (role=club_admin) for the purchasing user
- ✅ Sets `user_profiles.has_used_trial = true`
- ✅ If a matching org already exists by `stripe_customer_id`, revives/updates it instead of inserting

---

### Batch BG (May 2026) — Subscription lifecycle handlers

- ✅ `customer.subscription.updated` — updates plan (`priceIdToPlan`), status (`stripeToOrgStatus` map), `current_period_end` (item-level, SDK v22), `canceled_at`, `trial_ends_at`
- ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted` — sets status=canceled, canceled_at=now
- ✅ `invoice.payment_failed` — sets status=past_due
- ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded` — updates `current_period_end`; recovers past_due→active; leaves trialing untouched
- ✅ `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` — log only, no DB write
- All handlers look up org strictly by `stripe_customer_id`; rows with NULL stripe_customer_id are never touched
- `stripeToOrgStatus` map handles all Stripe statuses including unpaid, incomplete, incomplete_expired, paused

---

### Batch BH (May 2026) — Stripe webhook production rollout

- ✅ Created production Stripe webhook endpoint (`we_1TU453QL0gCVdJZiGrFL6B2N`): `https://fynlwhistle.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- ✅ Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated/deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded/failed`, `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set in Vercel Production env vars
- ✅ End-to-end smoke test passed: checkout → org created with `plan=club_5`, `status=trialing`, `trial_ends_at` 14 days out, `stripe_customer_id` populated
- ✅ 5 events logged in `stripe_events_processed` (idempotency confirmed)
- ✅ Test data cleaned up

---

## Next — what's left to do

### Move 3 — ✅ Shipped (Batch BI, May 2026)
- `/coach/organisation` — club_admin read-only: org name, plan, status, billing date, team count, coach seat count
- Club_admin gate fix in `app/coach/layout.tsx` — accepts `organisation_members` as well as `team_members`
- `isOrgAdminOnly` banner in coach layout — amber strip when viewing as club admin
- Team switcher in `CoachSidebar` — fetches all accessible teams, grouped by org, reactive via `ACTIVE_TEAM_CHANGED_EVENT`
- `lib/serverTeamContext.ts` org-admin fallback — returns context with `isOrgAdminOnly: true` when no `team_members` row
- Migration `20260506000000_move_3_org_access.sql` — org RLS policies, extended `can_read_team_data`, `resolve_active_team_id`, `set_active_team_id`

### Pre-launch checklist — do these before sharing with any club

**1. Live Stripe prices** (~1 hr) ← hard blocker
- Create live-mode prices in Stripe dashboard (monthly + annual for each plan)
- Update price IDs in `app/(marketing)/pricing/pricingConfig.ts`
- Create a second webhook endpoint in Stripe live mode with its own signing secret
- Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_live_...` in Vercel

**2. Sentry error monitoring** (~20 min) ← bundle with #1, same sitting
- Install `@sentry/nextjs`, run `npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs`
- Free tier is fine for this stage
- Gives immediate email alerts with stack traces when anything crashes in production
- Without this you are blind to errors real users hit

**3. Email delivery** (~1 hr) ← needed for signup confirmation to arrive reliably
- Resend: verify `fynlwhistle.com` domain status is `verified`
- Vercel DNS: add missing `_dmarc` TXT record `v=DMARC1; p=none;`
- Supabase Auth SMTP: route signup/reset emails through Resend with sender `FYNL Whistle <noreply@fynlwhistle.com>`

**4. Terms of Service + Privacy Policy** ✅ Done (May 2026)
- `/terms` and `/privacy` live — UK GDPR-compliant, covers all sub-processors
- Footer links added to marketing layout; legal disclaimer added to signup form
- GDPR note: if targeting UK/EU clubs, consider switching Supabase project region to EU (can be done in project settings before you have real data)

---
### ✅ READY TO SHARE WITH CLUBS — after the four items above are done

At this point: a club can discover the product, sign up, pay with a real card, receive a confirmation email, log in, and use the full coach app. The backend is complete and resilient.

**Confidence checklist before first outreach:**
- Know how to do a Vercel rollback (Deployments tab → find last working deploy → Redeploy). Practice it once.
- Bookmark Stripe dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → your live endpoint. Failed deliveries show here; one click to retry.
- Sentry is alerting to your email. Test it by deliberately triggering a 404.

---
### Post-launch — internal tooling

**5. Move 4 — Business admin panel** (`/admin/organisations`, `/admin/billing`)
- Internal visibility layer: customer list, MRR, subscription status, plan breakdown
- Data source: `organisations` table — status/plan/current_period_end kept in sync by webhooks
- Scope: read-only internal tool, no customer-facing UI
- Replaces the current admin stubs

**6. Stripe Customer Portal**
- Lets customers manage their own billing (cancel, upgrade, update card) without a custom billing UI
- One serverless function: create a Billing Portal session and redirect
- Until this exists, cancellations and card updates come to you manually — fine at low volume

### Post-launch — product

**7. Coach Review improvements** (Batch AX)
- Per-clip notes/comments field
- Quick-jump scrubber timeline with event markers
- Fullscreen video mode
- Export clip list as PDF for team presentations

**8. Wire up the contact form** — connect `app/(marketing)/contact/page.tsx` to Resend or CRM

### Around launch — quick marketing and UI wins
These are low-effort, high-signal for early clubs:

- **OG images** — add to `public/` so links shared in WhatsApp/Twitter show a branded preview card instead of a blank
- **Status page** — Instatus free tier, ~10 min setup. Clubs can check themselves if the app is slow rather than messaging you. Link it in the footer.
- **Early adopter framing on pricing page** — make sure the early adopter yearly offer messaging is current and compelling; first clubs respond to feeling like insiders
- **Trial period in Stripe checkout** — consider adding a 14-day free trial to the checkout session to reduce signup friction for the first wave of clubs
- **Simple welcome message** — even a plain-text email you send manually to the first 5–10 signups goes a long way; personal touch matters at this stage
- **Changelog or "what's new"** — a simple Notion page (or a `/updates` route) linked from the sidebar so early users feel the product is moving; clubs that can see active development stay engaged

### Longer-term

- Cloudflare Stream / HLS transcoding (revisit at >50 hrs stored video or mobile adaptive streaming needed)
- Mobile support
- Cross-match player trends backed by cloud data
- Shared team analysis links
- Advanced video annotation / telestration
- Plan limit enforcement (schema ready, code enforcement not yet built)
- Automated test suite (start with data transformation and export utilities)

## How we work — coding workflow

1. Paste this file at the start of every new Claude chat
2. Plan in Claude before touching code
3. Apply changes with Claude Code in VS Code — review every diff before accepting
4. Test in the browser after every change (`localhost:3000`)
5. Commit to git after each stable milestone
6. Update this file after major structural changes

### Rules for working with code
- `coach/capture/page.tsx` is large (~3,445 lines) — never rewrite the whole file, always use targeted find/replace
- Always read the current file before making changes — never guess from memory
- Stability over cleverness — app is live at fynlwhistle.com
- Test after every change before moving to the next

## Naming notes

- "Easts" appears in some internal variable names — treat as placeholder, will be made configurable during onboarding build
