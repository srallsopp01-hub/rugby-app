# Rugby Analysis App — Project Context File

**Last updated:** April 2026 — after Phase 10 (aesthetic and layout polish) complete  
**Purpose:** Paste this at the start of any new chat with Claude to restore full project context instantly.

## What this app is

A rugby match analysis web app built in **Next.js / React / TypeScript**.

It helps coaches:
- Upload and review match video
- Tag player and team events live or via transcript import
- Use voice tagging (push-to-talk via spacebar)
- Review team and player performance
- Generate analysis outputs and downloadable reports

It is currently a **coach-first MVP / early private beta**, best used on desktop/laptop, one coach per browser/device.

---

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (custom design tokens via CSS variables in `globals.css`)
- localStorage for match persistence (no backend/cloud yet)
- Anthropic API for voice transcription (`/api/transcribe`)
- ExcelJS for `.xlsx` report generation

---

## Platform structure — 4 layers

The app is split into four clearly separated layers with independent layouts and sidebars.

## Design tokens (globals.css)

Dark theme CSS variables available as Tailwind classes:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-background` | #0b0c0f | Base page background |
| `bg-background-elevated` | #111317 | Elevated surfaces |
| `bg-panel` | #17191d | Cards and panels |
| `bg-panel-2` | #1d2025 | Inset / secondary panels |
| `bg-panel-3` | #23272d | Active sidebar items |
| `text-foreground` | #d7dbe2 | Primary text |
| `text-foreground-strong` | #f1f4f8 | Headings / strong text |
| `text-muted` | #98a0ab | Secondary text |
| `text-muted-2` | #7e8793 | Tertiary / labels |
| `border-border` | #373c44 | Default borders |
| `border-border-light` | #505762 | Hover/active borders |
| `text-success` | #7ea37e | Muted green |
| `text-warning` | #b79a63 | Muted gold |
| `text-danger` | #b16e6e | Muted red |

Body has a radial + linear gradient applied. Buttons get `translateY(-1px)` on hover. Inputs have 0.18s transitions.

## Layout pattern (coach / player / admin)

All three platform layouts use the same structure:

```tsx
<div className="flex h-screen overflow-hidden">   // locks to viewport
  <Sidebar />
  <main className="flex-1 overflow-auto">          // only this scrolls
    {children}
  </main>
</div>
```

Sidebar pattern:
- 220px wide (coach/player) or 200px (admin)
- Left accent bar (`w-[3px] rounded-r-full bg-foreground-strong`) on active link
- Logo mark + platform name + sub-label in header
- `transition-all duration-150` on nav links
- "Private beta" footer label

---

## Data model summary

**Events** (`EventItem[]`) — core data structure. Each event has:
- `id`, `timestamp`, `text`, `rawText?`, `isPending?`
- `category`: `"player"` | `"set-piece"` | `"team"` | `"milestone"` | `"substitution"`
- Player events: `playerName?`, `playerAction?`, `secondPlayerName?`
- Set piece events: `setPieceType`, `setPieceSide`, `lineoutResult?`, `scrumResult?`, `notes?`
- Team events: `teamEventType`

**TeamEventType** (types.ts): `"penalty for"` | `"penalty conceded"` | `"try scored"` | `"try conceded"`

**MilestoneType** (types.ts): `"kick off"` | `"half time"` | `"second half kick off"` | `"full time"`

**RosterRow**: `number`, `name`, `position`, `minutes`

**SquadProfile** (lib/squadProfile.ts — cross-match, persistent): `id`, `teamName`, `coachName`, `primaryColour`, `secondaryColour`, `logoUrl`, `players[]`, `actionSamples[]`, `correctionMemory[]`

**SquadPlayer**: `id`, `fullName`, `preferredName`, `nicknames[]`, `primaryPosition`, `secondaryPositions[]`, `jerseyNumber`, `voiceSamples[]`, `status`

**CorrectionMemoryEntry**: `rawWhisperText`, `resolvedPlayerName`, `resolvedAction`, `count`

---

## Storage

- **Match session:** `localStorage` key `STORAGE_KEY` (defined in constants.ts)
- **Correction memory (v2):** `localStorage` key `CORRECTION_MEMORY_KEY`
- **Squad Profile (cross-match):** `localStorage` key `SQUAD_PROFILE_KEY` (via lib/squadProfile.ts)
- **Current match ID:** `localStorage` (via savedMatches lib)
- **Saved matches list:** `localStorage` (via savedMatches lib)
- **Video:** `sessionStorage` blob URL (not persisted across sessions)
- **No cloud storage yet**

---

## Important product rules (never break these)

1. **No hardcoded team logic in core product** — keep everything generalisable for any team
2. **Capture page is tagging only** — do not add analytics or clip review to it
3. **Insights is analytics only** — do not add clip review or tagging to it
4. **Review is teaching/review only** — do not add tagging to it
5. **No player logins yet** — player platform is UI scaffold only; coach-facing analysis only
6. **No cloud storage yet** — all persistence is browser localStorage
7. **Desktop-first** — not optimised for mobile
8. **Spacebar = voice recording only** — must never trigger a focused button
9. **Transcript always sorted by timestamp** — oldest at top, newest at bottom
10. **"Latest" badge follows highest timestamp**, not last array item
11. **Screens stay separate** — platform layers are independent, with their own layouts

---

## Spacebar / button focus fix pattern

**Fix pattern:** Every event-logging button must:
1. Have `type="button"` explicitly set
2. Call `event.currentTarget.blur()` immediately after its click handler runs via a `runAndBlur` helper

**Applied to:**
- ✅ `TeamEventsPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `MatchdayRosterPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `SetPieceLoggingPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `NeedsReviewPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `MatchMilestonesPanel.tsx`

If new event-logging buttons are added anywhere, apply this same pattern immediately.

---

## Voice matching pipeline — current state

1. Learned correction memory (per-session, v2 format) — fires first, bypasses everything else
2. Squad resolution of GPT's `parsed.player` — preferred name, nickname, surname
3. Token scan of rawText against squad — squad candidates built
4. `tokenResolvedName` promoted if unique token match and no parsed player
5. `parsedPlayerIsValid` = resolved OR token-resolved OR exact roster match
6. Auto-match: `hasKnownAction && parsedPlayerIsValid && highEnoughConfidence`
7. Pending Resolution: `hasKnownAction && mergedCandidates.length > 0` (squad candidates first)
8. Needs Review: everything else

Double-tackle support: when `squadCandidates.length >= 2` and action is tackle, second player pre-filled in `PendingResolutionPanel`.

## What was completed

### Batch A (April 2026)
- ✅ Added "Penalty For" as a Team Event button
- ✅ Removed "Steal" and "Penalty" from lineout result dropdown
- ✅ Spacebar fix applied to all event-logging panels
- ✅ Transcript sorted by timestamp; "Latest" badge follows highest timestamp

### Batch B (April 2026)
- ✅ Lineout Call Summary added to Match Report modal
- ✅ Lineout Calls sheet added to .xlsx download (Sheet 3)
- ✅ Download strategy simplified — one report, one transcript download
- ✅ Dead code removed

### Batch C (April 2026)
- ✅ Match milestone buttons (Kick Off, Half Time, Second Half KO, Full Time)
- ✅ Bench bring-on flow with substitution logging
- ✅ Squad Profile lib created (`lib/squadProfile.ts`)
- ✅ `/squad` page — team details, add/edit/remove players
- ✅ `resolvePlayerName()` — resolves against fullName, preferredName, nicknames, surname
- ✅ Token scanning of rawText against squad
- ✅ Correction memory split to v2 (player + action stored separately)
- ✅ Double-tackle support — second player tracked, text and export updated

### Route architecture migration — Phases 1–9 (April 2026)
- ✅ Phase 1: Repo scaffold (App Router folders, routing plan)
- ✅ Phase 2: globals.css dark theme tokens, root layout
- ✅ Phase 3: `/team-dashboard` → `/coach/insights`
- ✅ Phase 4: `/game-review` → `/coach/review`
- ✅ Phase 5: `/player-dashboard` → `/coach/players`
- ✅ Phase 6: `/saved-matches` → `/coach/saved-matches`
- ✅ Phase 7: Workspace → `/coach/capture`
- ✅ Phase 8: Public marketing homepage at `/`
- ✅ Phase 9: `/player` and `/admin` layout scaffolds with sidebars
- Old redirect stubs remain at legacy routes for now

### Phase 10 — Aesthetic and layout polish (April 2026)
- ✅ Layout fix: coach/player/admin use `h-screen overflow-hidden`, sidebar stays fixed
- ✅ Coach sidebar: left accent bar on active link, RugbyCoach logo mark, refined transitions
- ✅ Player/Admin sidebars: same accent bar + logo mark treatment applied
- ✅ Marketing layout: logo mark in header, tighter button styling
- ✅ Marketing homepage: radial hero glow, contrast headline, status dot badge, feature cards with icons and hover, CTA in panel card
- ✅ Coach Home: quick nav card grid to Capture / Insights / Review / Players
- ✅ All stub pages: consistent "In development" amber badge + dashed-border placeholder + purposeful description

### Batch D (April 2026)
- ✅ Voice tagging during video playback — removed native `<video controls>`, added custom Play/Pause button + seek bar; spacebar no longer pauses video
- ✅ Team Setup page — `/coach/team-setup` was already live (completed in Phase 7 migration); `/squad` redirects to it
- ✅ Collapsible coach sidebar — animates 220px ↔ 56px (icon-only), persists to localStorage, chevron toggle, native title tooltips
- ✅ Needs Review volume — Whisper prompt with player names + action words; expanded GPT action synonyms (jackal→turnover, run→carry, etc.); preferred names + nicknames sent to API

---

## Next — Batch E (plan carefully before starting)

Ideas (not yet prioritised):
- Further Needs Review reduction — smarter confidence thresholds, partial surname matching
- Collapsible sidebar for Player layout (mirrors coach pattern)
- Clip tagging / video annotation on the Review screen
- Cross-match player trends in Insights
- Onboarding flow (first-time setup wizard)

---

## Longer-term (don't prioritise yet)

- Cloud storage and coach accounts
- Player logins and season dashboards
- Custom KPI systems
- Onboarding flow
- Video annotation / telestration
- Cross-match player trends
- Shared team analysis links
- Mobile support

## How we work — coding workflow

1. Paste this file at the start of every new Claude chat
2. Plan in Claude before touching code
3. Apply changes with Claude Code in VS Code — review every diff before accepting
4. Test in the browser after every change (`localhost:3000`)
5. Commit to git after each stable milestone
6. Update this file after major structural changes

### Rules for working with code
- `coach/capture/page.tsx` is large (~2600 lines) — never rewrite the whole file, always use targeted find/replace
- Always read the current file before making changes — never guess from memory
- Stability over cleverness — app is live in private beta
- Test after every change before moving to the next

---

## Naming notes

- "Easts" appears in some internal variable names — treat as placeholder, will be made configurable during onboarding build
